# DogFoodCalculator
blazor WASM - calculates the quantity of raw dog food based on weight

It's based on % of weight and activity level/ideal weight

Guide is based on 80/10/10 principle i.e. 80% protein, 10% offal and 10% bone

Currently this works with kgs and returns the results in grams.

To do:
1. Add imperial option (lbs and oz)
2. Alternate calulation for puppies (age + weight or expected adult weight)
3. Finish CSS
